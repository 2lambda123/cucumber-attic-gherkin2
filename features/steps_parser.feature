Feature: Gherkin Steps lexer
  In order to save time and make my features clearer
  As a Cucumber developer
  I want a steps lexer to make writing compound steps easier

  Background:
    Given an English-language steps lexer
    
  Scenario: Parsing steps
    Given the following text is parsed:
      """
      Given a one step
      And a two step
        \"\"\"
        Here is a multiline string
        That follows a step
        With an argument #{arg}
        \"\"\"
      And a one two three step
      When another step
      Then there should be a table
        | one | two | three  |
        | foo | bar | #{arg} |
      """
    Then there should be no syntax errors
    
  Scenario: Trying to parse a full feature with the step lexer
    Given the following text is parsed:
      """
      Feature: A Feature
        Scenario: Yes, there is one
          Given I have a step
          When I execute this step
          Then something should happen
      """
    Then there should be syntax errors on lines 1 and 2
    
  Scenario: Tags
    Given the following text is parsed:
      """
      @a_tag
      Given a step
      When I trip
      Then I should sign up for dancing lessons
      """
    Then there should be a syntax error on line 1
