Building and Running the js lexer
=================================

You need Node.js and http://github.com/dominicmarks/ragel-js installed. Then:

  rake js/lib/gherkin/lexer/en.js && node js/example/print.js spec/gherkin/fixtures/1.feature

Or: (using therubyracer)

  rake js/lib/gherkin/lexer/en.js && ruby js/example/print.rb spec/gherkin/fixtures/1.feature 

That prints gherkin to stdout - almost like the original. Well, not quite, but you get the idea. We're firing events.
