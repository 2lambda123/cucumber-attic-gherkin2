    # TIP: When you hack on the grammar, just delete feature.rb in this directory.
    # Also make sure you have uninstalled all cucumber gems (don't forget xxx-cucumber
    # github gems).
    #
    # Treetop will then generate the parser in-memory. When you're happy, just generate
    # the rb file with tt feature.tt
